This project contains different small C++ programms which were made during C++ course for beginners.

All programs stored here in order to avoid creating many different small procjects.

Source code of each program located in individual directory. Name of a directory and *.cpp file contains such information:
1. Lecture number in format **l + number**;
2. Type of exercise:
   1. **Exercise** for normal exercises;
   2. **Challenge** for challenges;

> For example. l99-challenge means that this program is for lecture 99 challenge.

Git flow is needed to store the history of learning through the course and also to facilitate the process of working on different programms in one project.

The rules of using Git flow in this project are simple:
1. Each new program considered feature;
2. Finished program considered release;

Release versions contain information about course status, section number and lecture number:
1. The first number shows the status of the course if it's finished or not;
2. The second number is a section number;
3. The third number is a lecture number;

> For example. v0.12.78 means that the program was made for lecture 78 of section 12.

Right now all binary files are ignored to avoid innecessary commits.
